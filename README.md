# 100 Days of Python - Code Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repo is dedicated to my journey of mastering Python through the **100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** course by Angela Yu. Over the next 100 days, I'll be coding daily and building projects using Python. This repository contains all my work, from learning the basics to more advanced projects.

## About the Course

This course covers everything from the basics of Python to advanced topics like web development, data science, game development, automation, and machine learning. By the end of the course, I'll have built 100 unique projects, each helping me to master various aspects of Python programming.

The course includes topics such as:

- Python 3 and its libraries
- Python scripting and automation
- Web scraping with Beautiful Soup and Selenium
- Game development (e.g., Snake game, Blackjack)
- Data science with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- Web development with Flask and SQL databases
- GUI app development with Tkinter
- And much more...

You can find a complete list of all the topics covered in the course in the course description.
